/*
  This complex JavaScript code generates a Mandelbrot fractal image using the HTML5 canvas.
  The code uses advanced mathematical calculations to determine the color of each pixel in the image.
  With over 200 lines of code, it provides a highly detailed and visually appealing result.

  To execute this code, you can simply open an HTML file and include an empty canvas element
  with id="fractal-canvas". Then copy and paste this code into a <script> tag below the canvas.

  Note that due to the complex nature of the algorithm and the large canvas size, generating
  the fractal image may take a few seconds or more depending on your machine's processing power.

  Happy fractal exploring!
